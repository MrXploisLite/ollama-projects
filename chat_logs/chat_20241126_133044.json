      "content": "Romy Rianata! Here's a simple \"Hello World\" program in C++:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    std::cout << \"Hello, World!\" << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nLet me explain what's going on here:\n\n- The `#include <iostream>` line tells the compiler to include the iostream library. This library provides functions for input and output operations.\n- The `int main()` function is the entry point of your program. It returns an integer (in this case, 0) when it's done.\n- The `std::cout` statement prints the string \"Hello, World!\" to the console, followed by a newline character (`std::endl`). The `std::` part indicates that we're using functions from the standard library.\n\nTo compile and run this program, you can use a C++ compiler like g++:\n\n1. Save the code in a file with a .cpp extension (e.g., hello.cpp).\n2. Compile the program: `g++ -o hello hello.cpp`\n3. Run the program: `./hello`\n\nThis will print \"Hello, World!\" to the console.\n\nHow was that? Do you have any questions or would you like me to help with anything else?"
